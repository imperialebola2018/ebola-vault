Vault is now running in montagu-vault container.

The next step depends on if you are starting a brand new vault or restoring
the existing vault from backup (or restarting it after a machine reboot)

1. For a brand new vault:

    docker exec -it montagu-vault ./init.sh
    docker exec -it montagu-vault vault unseal # (multiple times until unsealed)
    docker exec -it montagu-vault ./first-time-setup.sh

2. To recover or restart the vault, run from any host on the VPN

    export VAULT_ADDR=https://support.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk:8200
    vault unseal # multiple times until unsealed
